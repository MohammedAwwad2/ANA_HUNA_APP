🧏‍♂️ Ana Huna: Arabic Sign Language Converter
Ana Huna (أنا هنا), meaning "I am here" in Arabic, is an AI-powered application designed to bridge the communication gap between the deaf community and the hearing world. This innovative tool converts Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) into text and speech — and vice versa — using cutting-edge computer vision and Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling seamless real-time communication and accessibility.

🌍 Vision
Ana Huna empowers deaf individuals in the Arab world by enabling real-time, bi-directional communication with hearing people and intelligent systems. It is more than an app — it is a movement toward inclusion, accessibility, and independence.
